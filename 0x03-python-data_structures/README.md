# 0x03. Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

## Definition

### Lists:
List can be written as a list of comma-separated values (items) between square
brackets. Lists might contain items of different types, but usually the items
all have the same type.
Lists are a mutable type, i.e. it is possible to change their content.


### Tuples
Though tuples may seem similar to lists, they are often used in different
situations and for different purposes. Tuples are immutable, and usually contain
an heterogeneous sequence of elements that are accessed via unpacking (see later
in this section) or indexing (or even by attribute in the case of namedtuples).
